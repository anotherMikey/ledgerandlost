            <h1>Ledger and Lost</h1>
            <p>Welcome to <b>Ledger and Lost</b>, a world devoid of normal hope replaced with noxious particles and gas. 
                This dystopia is an unusual mixing of common Western and Steampunk, creating what I like to call “Dustpunk.”</p>
            <p>You will be playing as part of a group of people called “Category 43.” Below is a concise introduction to what you need to know about some of the game in order to get started on creating some ideas for a character. I am happy to ask any questions and work with you as much as you like.</p>
            <p>Feel free to listen to this as you read through-- for ambience!: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ-SZRQaRqg">Lab Practicum</a></p>

                            <p>Appointed by Apocryth, the Clergy rules over the esteemed city of Braefall and its people. An all-powerful governing body, they are the first and final decree of law, information, and religion.</p>
                            <p>The Grand Mur sits at the top of the chain. Their personal identity is hidden; their face is always hidden behind a mask. No official appointment of a new Grand Mur has been released to the public since the Reckoning.</p>
                            


                            
                            
                            <p>The origin of the Clergy has been forgotten by the general populace due to the passage of time. They are believed to be the only reason Braefall has survived this long, and they promise to continue to bring prosperity to all citizens.</p>
