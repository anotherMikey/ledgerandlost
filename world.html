            <h1>Ledger and Lost</h1>
            <p>Welcome to <b>Ledger and Lost</b>, a world devoid of normal hope replaced with noxious particles and gas. 
                This dystopia is an unusual mixing of common Western and Steampunk, creating what I like to call “Dustpunk.”</p>
            <p>You will be playing as part of a group of people called “Category 43.” Below is a concise introduction to what you need to know about some of the game in order to get started on creating some ideas for a character. I am happy to ask any questions and work with you as much as you like.</p>
            <p>Feel free to listen to this as you read through-- for ambience!: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ-SZRQaRqg">Lab Practicum</a></p>

                <h2>The Reckoning</h2>
                <p><i>“How long has it been since you’ve touched the dirt? How much longer will it be?” — Amano Kuze</i></p>
                <p>The Reckoning took many lives. In short, the ground grew hungry and absorbed all organic life standing atop it. Flora and Fauna both, everything standing on natural soil withered away and died in seconds; there was no warning.</p>
                <p>For a long time after, any who step foot on soil would meet the same fate regardless of how thick their sole was.</p>
                <p>The term: “Reckoning” refers to both the instant necrotic death of the majority of organic life, as well as the duration of time where the ground was unsafe to traverse.</p>
                <p>The Clergy revoked the citizenship of the Category 43 before the Reckoning, and now claim that the Reckoning was caused due to something unholy on their part; the citizens believe them of course. All the Category 43 know is that they are wholly unwelcome inside the city by all parties.</p>

                <h2>Climate</h2>
                <p>The climate of the world is now very extreme. Daytime is scorching, regularly reaching temperatures of 100-120 degrees. Nighttime gets terribly cold due to the lack of oxygen to insulate throughout the night. Temperatures ranging from the negatives to 40 degrees are common.</p>
                <p>Huge storms form in a few days, and are very common. Cloud-to-Cloud arcs dominate, lightning is blindingly bright. Rain is sparse, and formulates as acid rain (due to HNO3); corroding metal and eating through stone.</p>
                <hr/>
                <h2>Landscape</h2>
                <p>The organic life on this world is dead and gone. In the wake of the Reckoning, once-lush valleys were left as sweltering pits full of dense air. Calm plains are now dry and cracked desperately trying to remember what once was. Higher elevations have lighter air and are considered “safer.” Agriculture is impossible without extreme care.</p>
                <hr/>
                <h2>Visual</h2>
                <p>The now fabled blue sky that once was is now permanently in a brown-orange haze, sometimes a sickly green-gray on poorer days. A long drawn-out sunset appears daily as bloodreds and coppers. High altitude yellow-gray cloud bands trace the sky, almost mocking the tilled farmland of a bygone age. Occasional Auroras appear when enough magic is released into the surrounding area.</p>
                <hr/>
                <h2>Health</h2>
                <p>Respiratory masks are a must when exposed to these conditions. Without it, respiratory problems will arise. Acidosis: memory loss, cognition failure, fatigue, confusion, rapid breathing, muscle weakness and bone-thinning WILL occur, as well as potential Hypoxia.</p>
                <hr/>
                <h2>Fire</h2>
                <p>Because of the lacking of Fire Air, nonmagical fire is now a holy symbol, due to its rarity. It is worshipped, ceremonial, and rare to see. The clergy abuses their influence to get access to more fire, deepening the faith of the people in them. Magical fire is seen as heresy. Fire is difficult to achieve because the lack of Fire Air in the atmosphere makes for normal means of producing flame to be unreliable. Sparks, matches, and other means are entirely ineffective. When a fire manages to light, it burns quickly and HOT. This makes boiling water for cooking and everything else very difficult.</p>
