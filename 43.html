            <h1>Ledger and Lost</h1>
            <p>Welcome to <b>Ledger and Lost</b>, a world devoid of normal hope replaced with noxious particles and gas. 
                This dystopia is an unusual mixing of common Western and Steampunk, creating what I like to call “Dustpunk.”</p>
            <p>You will be playing as part of a group of people called “Category 43.” Below is a concise introduction to what you need to know about some of the game in order to get started on creating some ideas for a character. I am happy to ask any questions and work with you as much as you like.</p>
            <p>Feel free to listen to this as you read through-- for ambience!: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ-SZRQaRqg">Lab Practicum</a></p>

                <h2>Soulless</h2>
                <p>As deemed by Doctrine Bill #86, the Category 43 are sub-sentient entities. Category 43 individuals are unable to be registered by "Soul Devices"--scanners and other technologies that act based off of the user's soul.
                    Because of their lack of ability to interact with these devices, they have also been classified as "soulless."
                </p>
                <p>In addition to their lacking ability to interact with soul receptacles, Category 43:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Do not leave footprints in holy ground/soil</p></li>
                        <li><p>Are unable to step through the holy gates of the wall separating Deadlock from Braefall</p></li>
                    </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="Exiled">
                <h2>Exiled</h2>
                <p>Deadlock is the habitation that the Category 43s are allowed to live in. Most of it is composed of abandoned buildings that were formerly on the outskirts of Braefall. They purposely got left on the other side of the walls upon construction.</p>
                <p>This allowed for easy shelter for the Category 43s, but they certainly weren’t the nicest of abodes. Tumbling brick homes, decrepit shops, and the formerly abandoned Cradlebank Keep are all that Today’s Category 43s can familiarize themselves with. They are unfamiliar with the relatively clean and well-furnished rooms the citizens of Braefall have.</p>

            <section id="Arcanum">
                <h2>Arcanum</h2>
                <p>Due to its association with the Category 43, Apocryth and its appointed Clergy have deemed all Arcane Arts to be unholy.</p>
                <p>Regardless of their own ability to produce magic, anyone associated with the arcane arts is classified as a Category 43--and are immediately exiled from Braefall. If somewhere is to awaken as "arcane-potent" while living in Braefall, they too are exiled.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Not all Category 43 can use the arcane arts. But anyone who can? You'll find them in Deadlock.</p>
                <p>Healing magic--proper "holy" arts, are reserved for Clergy members only. None in Deadlock are capable of recreating the Clergy's healing feats.</p>

            <section id="Enlisted">
                <h2>Enlisted</h2>
                <p><i>“Listen, if you want a surefire way to better your situation, there’s only one option: Enlist. Either you find success or die trying. Both sounded like an improvement to me.” — Silas “Kaiser” Kaidan</i></p>
                <p>Some Category 43 choose to enlist themselves and their strength in the Braefall militia, in return for increased shipments of supplies from the "Motherland" as the Braefall citizens call it.</p>
                <p>Squads are assigned personal callsigns, and squadron names. Those who enlist often replace their House name with their Squadron name.
                    Each squad is assigned a commanding officer, or "Handler." These officers are Braefall citizens who give out missio assignments and communicate data. 
                    All relations between Enlisted 43 and Handlers are strictly business. Names are used instead of Callsigns.
                    In addition, Handlers are prone to toying with the lives of Enlisted 43 by carelessly giving out misinformation and sending their squads into suicide situations. They don't get any reprecussions for it, and they don't care; Category 43 are officially sub-sentient.
                </p>
                <p>Why don't the Enlisted 43 fight back, you ask? The Handlers are safe in Braefall, communicating over technology. They never leave the comfort of their bubble, so the Enlisted 43 can never reach them.
                    Enlisted 43 never know if information is good or not until they arrive on scene.
                </p>
                <p>Handlers can afford to be careless with their squads because there are plenty of Category 43 willing to enlist. The promise of extra supplies is too good to give up.</p>
