            <h1>Ledger and Lost</h1>
            <p>Welcome to <b>Ledger and Lost</b>, a world devoid of normal hope replaced with noxious particles and gas. 
                This dystopia is an unusual mixing of common Western and Steampunk, creating what I like to call “Dustpunk.”</p>
            <p>You will be playing as part of a group of people called “Category 43.” Below is a concise introduction to what you need to know about some of the game in order to get started on creating some ideas for a character. I am happy to ask any questions and work with you as much as you like.</p>
            <p>Feel free to listen to this as you read through-- for ambience!: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ-SZRQaRqg">Lab Practicum</a></p>

            <p>Deadlock is the habitation that the Category 43s are allowed to live in. Most of it is composed of abandoned buildings that were formerly on the outskirts of Braefall. They purposely got left on the other side of the walls upon construction.</p>
            <p>This allowed for easy shelter for the Category 43s, but they certainly weren’t the nicest of abodes. Tumbling brick homes, decrepit shops, and the formerly abandoned Cradlebank Keep are all that Today’s Category 43s can familiarize themselves with. They are unfamiliar with the relatively clean and well-furnished rooms the citizens of Braefall have.</p>

            <h2>The [Shopping] District</h2>
            <p><i>“Dale won’t take down his goddamn spoke! It encroaches on House Eta!” - upset neighbor of House Eta.</i></p>
            <p>The once lively interior of the Aspen Shopping Complex is now a littered conglomeration of a refugee camp--this is where the majority of Category 43 live.</p>
            <p>The four wings of the mall have been transformed into a series of "Houses." These act like factions Category 43 associate themselves with. The house you live in determines your last name. The Houses themselves are composed of repurposed shops and stores.</p>
            <p>Under the leadership of their own Margrave (leader), the Houses are as follows:</p>
            <table class="center">

            <h3>Washrooms</h3>
            <p>In the center of the District are the washrooms. </p>
            <p>Water is reused. After each inhabitant is finished bathing, the used water is heated up and boiled to rid of any unwanted matter. If water level is low after the fact, refills can be requested at the “reception.”</p>
            <h3>Sustenance</h3>
            <p>Each House pays for shipments from Braefall of food using a portion of the rent from each patron. Because food is limited, portions are limited and extras are required to be returned.
                Dedicated eating areas within each House are the only places deemed suitable for food consumption.</p>
            <h3>Rules of the District</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>All food provisions are provided along with your rent payment. No sustenance is to be taken out of the dining halls. This is considered, selfish, greedy, and gluttonous.</li>
                    <li>Washrooms are composed of makeshift tubs, and are located in the center of the entire mall, meaning they’re communal. No sort of thieving, murder, or related violent/aggressive activities are permitted. Washrooms are “safe havens.” Individuals or groups found in violation of this rule are immediately evicted from the District—they are left to their own accord. This usually results in them becoming more aggressive and chaotic.*</li>       
                </ol>
                <small>*A lemma of the above rule: talking or communication in the washrooms is typically seen as rude or dangerous, even though permitted.</small>

            <h3>Culture</h3>
            <p><i>“There’s nothing holding me back from ending it all, so why am I still here?” — Kendo Kannae</i></p>

            <p>With the dense population inside the single building, naturally things are going to get a little tense between Houses. Turf wars, policy disputes, etc. This causes shootouts, brawls, and other fights to break out.</p>
            <p>Most individuals tend to stick with only associating themselves with others from their House or Wing, so isolationism is very apparent.</p>
            <p>A notable exception: House Zeta and House Eta are constantly disputing over the smallest things, being in the same wing. The two used to be only House Zeta, but a small revolution happened and House Eta seceded from House Zeta.</p>

            <h3>Dust Dwellers</h3>
            <p>Those who live outside the district are either very well off, or are very isolationist. The cost of heating, food provisions, and everything else is very steep. Usually, they live relatively close to the district, but they don’t have to.</p>

        <section id="SGs">
            <h2>Slimey Gee's (SG's)</h2>
            <p>Once an array of storage units, this bazaar consists of parallel rows of rolling garage doors. Large cloths affixed between wall stakes obscure the super heat of the sun from heating up the area. These cloths cause the bazaar to be very humid, dark, and musty (together, still preferable to the heat).</p>
            <h3>Heating</h3>
            <p>Shopkeepers all set aside a monthly budget to purchase plenty of snapglass to heat their individual shops. Without the snapglass they would get no business due to freezing customers in addition to their own freezing skin.</p>
            <h3>Lighting</h3>
            <p>Again the sun’s light and heat does not reach this area, thus other lighting solutions were created. Using arcane magics, glowing signs and other light fixtures are arranged all over the area. Some signs are branded, most aren’t. This gives the bazaar a very dusty cyberpunk vibe (with the neon-like signs)</p>
        </section>
            <hr/>
        <section id="Cradlebank">
            <h2>Cradlebank Keep</h2>
            <p>Cradlebank Keep sits atop the first bit of high ground of the Braefall area, thus receiving its name. In the past it was the first line of defense from opposing nations, now it is the first line of defense from the Contagion.</p>
            <p>For what little attraction it has, Cradlebank serves as a sort of Guildhall for those who wish to dedicate themselves to exploration, alchemy, or anything else of the like.
                In addition to its Guildhall purpose, the old keep also is the meeting place for Deadlock's Council.
            </p>
        </section>

        <hr/>

        <section id="Economy">
            <h2>Currency and Economy</h2>
            <p>The economy of Deadlock is a fickle one, as in no one ever really knows when the value of items is going to change. Surge pricing is commonplace due to supply sent by Braefall.</p>
            <p>There are two types of currency that Category 43s can use: Corks and Chits. </p>
            <p>Corks are literally corks from old bottles or potions. There is the outstanding issue that they are still used for such purposes, but there have been small adjustments to make for attached metal corks for the use cases above. As currency, these are not really worth much, but are the common currency for Deadlock.</p>
            <p>Chits are rare shards of pottery granted by the churches that hold maximum value and buying power. They are used to redeem advanced technology for the Category 43s (said technology is ancient for the Clergy) to aid them in their missions or however they may choose. Chits can usually comfortably fit within an enclosed palm, but there are weird outliers.</p>
