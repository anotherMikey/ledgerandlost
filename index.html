            <h1>Ledger and Lost</h1>
            <p>Welcome to <b>Ledger and Lost</b>, a world devoid of normal hope replaced with noxious particles and gas. 
                This dystopia is an unusual mixing of common Western and Steampunk, creating what I like to call “Dustpunk.”</p>
            <p>You will be playing as part of a group of people called “Category 43.” Below is a concise introduction to what you need to know about some of the game in order to get started on creating some ideas for a character. I am happy to ask any questions and work with you as much as you like.</p>
            <p>Feel free to listen to this as you read through-- for ambience!: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ-SZRQaRqg">Lab Practicum</a></p>

                <h2>Gameplay -- What You Need to Know</h2>
                    <h3>Classes</h3>
                        <p>As players, the classes of Cleric, Paladin, and Druid are prohibited due to lore and thematic reasons. Alternatives to healing magic will be supplied, so don’t freak out. I also have a something special for the rogue class, if anyone is interested.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Ancestry</h3>
                        <p>Ancestry-wise (species, race, whatever you call it) there aren’t too many limitations I want to impose. I imagine you guys will stick to typical ones but others are available. However, things like Aasimars and Tortles will be a little difficult to explain, I’d be able to work something out if that is what you REALLY want.</p>
                 
                    <h3>Guns</h3>
                    <p>Yes, there are guns. We can talk about how they work.</p>
                    <h3>What is Steampunk?</h3>
                        <p>Steampunk can be simply presented with the question: “What if we never harnessed the power of electricity?” This world is still fantasy, but definitely has some bonuses to technology akin to the industrial revolution.</p>
                    <h3>Visual Inspiration</h3>
                        <p>Style-wise, I take a lot of inspiration from Victorian-Era France, Pioneer-Era American Southwest, and Industrial Revolution-Era Russia. Clothing comes from each era in a mix and match fashion, and sometimes there are adornments consisting of brass and glass. I have a large Pinterest board I can share if anyone needs some good inspiration.</p>
                
<hr/>

                <p>I will encourage a heavy role-play atmosphere if you guys are down for it (there will be still be plenty of action). I would love to provide a gritty game that is full of its own unique atmosphere. Of course, it’s not all serious, we’re here to have fun after all. If that doesn’t pique some interest, I’ll dial back some, don’t worry.</p>
                <p>Please, please please scour this website before you begin solidifying things about your character. And please come talk with me about any ideas you have, even if you’re iffy on them or think they’re stupid. I’m here for all of it and am so excited to help you guys craft something that fits the world.</p>
                <p>If you don’t want to do too much on character/backstory stuff that is A-OK, I’ll be doing my own in the background for you anyway.</p>
                <p>But seriously if you have an idea talk to me about it, I can make pretty much anything work.</p>
                <h3>With all that out of the way, go read all the stuffs!</h3>
