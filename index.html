            <h1>Ledger and Lost</h1>
            <p>Welcome to <b>Ledger and Lost</b>, a world devoid of normal hope replaced with noxious particles and gas. 
                This dystopia is an unusual mixing of common Western and Steampunk, creating what I like to call “Dustpunk.”</p>
            <p>You will be playing as part of a group of people called “Category 43.” Below is a concise introduction to what you need to know about some of the game in order to get started on creating some ideas for a character. I am happy to ask any questions and work with you as much as you like.</p>
            <small>Note: Some of this is subject to major changes before gameplay starts. Also, there’s a chance I missed something important in this document. I have so many note documents it was difficult deciding what you need to know right now. There is so much more I could add, but this document already has 2,000 words. So just ask if you’re confused please. </small>

                <h2>Gameplay -- What You Need to Know</h2>
                <p>As players, the classes of Cleric, Paladin, and Druid are prohibited due to lore and thematic reasons. Alternatives to healing magic will be supplied, so don’t freak out. I also have a something special for the rogue class, if anyone is interested.</p>
                <p>Ancestry-wise (species, race, whatever you call it) there aren’t too many limitations I want to impose. I imagine you guys will stick to typical ones but others are available. However, things like Aasimars and Tortles will be a little difficult to explain, I’d be able to work something out if that is what you REALLY want.</p>
                <p>I will encourage a heavy role-play atmosphere if you guys are down for it (there will be still be plenty of action). I would love to provide a gritty game that is full of its own unique atmosphere. Of course, it’s not all serious, we’re here to have fun after all. If that doesn’t pique some interest, I’ll dial back some, don’t worry.</p>
                <p>Steampunk can be simply presented with the question: “What if we never harnessed the power of electricity?” This world is still fantasy, but definitely has some bonuses to technology akin to the industrial revolution.</p>
                <p>Style-wise, I take a lot of inspiration from Victorian-Era France, Pioneer-Era American Southwest, and Industrial Revolution-Era Russia. Clothing comes from each era in a mix and match fashion, and sometimes there are adornments consisting of brass and glass. I have a large Pinterest board I can share if anyone needs some good inspiration.</p>
                <p>Please, please please read this before you begin solidifying things about your character. And please come talk with me about any ideas you have, even if you’re iffy on them or think they’re stupid. I’m here for all of it and am so excited to help you guys craft something that fits the world.</p>
                <p>If you don’t want to do too much on character/backstory stuff that is A-OK, I’ll be doing my own in the background for you anyway.</p>
                <p>But seriously if you have an idea talk to me about it, I can make pretty much anything work.</p>

            <section id="Expatriates">
                <h2>Expatriates</h2>
                <p><i>“There’s nothing holding me back from ending it all, so why am I still here?” — Kendo Kannae</i></p>
                <p>Category 43 officially fall under the classification of “soulless”, deemed by the Clergy. Thus they are ill-fit to live in Braefall proper. Separated from normal civilization and economy, Category 43 still possess a resource everyone else does not: the Arcane.</p>
                <p>The Clergy claims arcane magics to be unholy and impure attempts to match holy power. Those who are able to wield arcane magics--or are associated with those who can--are physically unable to interact with some technology in Braefall. Public standing of these individuals reached an all-time low, labeling them as sinners and impure. Doctrine Bill #86, or the “Anechoic Protection Clause”, officially revokes citizenship and sentient-standing from this group; instead placing them into the 43rd category of sentient life (underneath fungus and insects): the “Soulless.”</p>
                <p>To the Category 43, the Clergy is unjust and oppressive. What is now known as Deadlock—where the 43 reside— receives almost no aid from Braefall. Nowadays, the inhabitants of Deadlock get their resources from their excursions.</p>
                <h3>Disrespected Yet Requested</h3>
                <p>Although every Category 43 is looked down upon with scorn, they serve a great purpose to Braefall.</p>
                <p>Due to the state of the world, any remaining lifeforms must find ways to survive. At this point in time, that means mooching off of intelligent civilization. Beasts and monsters alike close in more and more to Braefall as time progresses. Resilient oceanic-based lifeforms have evolved to survive outside of their natural habitat. Being on the outskirts of Braefall, the Category 43 are the first, and virtually last line of defense from these creatures. They protect themselves from the foes, but end up protecting everyone in Braefall because of it.</p>
                <p>Due to the smog and tainted air, bright colors stand out. These seem to attract more unwanted, hostile entities.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="Clergy">
                <h2>Braefall and the Clergy</h2>
                <p>Braefall is an oligarchy under rule of the Clergy. Every citizen of Braefall has unwavering devotion to the Clergy. The Clergy protects every citizen using their holy power and technology; most notably the Aceta and dome filtering out the unclean air.</p>
                <p>Before the Reckoning, the area around Braefall was very lush and green. At the same time, Braefall was a leader in technological and Magical innovation. Post Reckoning, no contact has been made with the outside world; the common belief is that Braefall is the last civilization on the planet.</p>
                <p>The Clergy revoked the citizenship of the Category 43 before the Reckoning, and now claim that the Reckoning was caused due to something unholy on their part; the citizens believe them of course. All the Category 43 know is that they are wholly unwelcome inside the city by all parties.</p>
                <p>The origin of the Clergy is forgotten to the general populace due to the passage of time. They are believed to be the only reason Braefall has survived this long, and they promise to continue to bring prosperity to all citizens.</p>
    
            </section>
            <section id="Deadlock">
                <h2>The Slums -- "Deadlock"</h2>
                <p>The entire area where the Category 43 live can be described as a slum. Dusty brick homes with corroded sheetmetal roofing line inept wooden walkways raised off the arid earth by dry rotted support beams. Sharp wind blasts through scattered neighborhoods, whistling in and out of spaces to create scream-like psithurism which fall flat in the dense air.</p>
                <p>These housing developments are built to encompass a large circle around spires of crystallized salt called the ‘Aceta.” Due to atmospheric conditions, the planet is no longer properly insulated to maintain heat. These giant crystals generate a livable radius of proper temperature so that citizens may wake up every morning. While operated by Clergy, the Category 43 would be long deceased without them.</p>
                <p>In addition to the Category 43, there are a few other exiles of Braefall who have no choice but to live a amongst the "sinners"</p>
                <h3>The Aceta</h3>
                <p><i>“If for whatever reason you’re not at your place by nightfall, make some quick amends. I’d suggest praying, but that’s far out of the picture for us” — Lemon Yanami</i></p>
                <p>During the night, everyone stays in their home near these crystals to sleep safely, including Category 43. However there is a divide between the normal citizens and Category 43. Normal citizens are on the inner city side, while the Category 43 are on the outer city side. They can see each other quite well, and insult each other throughout the night. They are “divided by doctrine, but unified by desperation.”</p>
                <h3>Habitation Hierarchy</h3>
                <p><i>“You’re never sure if the screaming you hear is the wind, or some poor, unfortunate soul who stepped on the wrong board.” — Natasha Nouzen</i></p>
                <p>The ‘shanty towns’ that Category 43 call precincts have a clear hierarchy proportional between altitude and wealth. Due to the unsafe earth during the Reckoning, every precinct was designed to be completely navigable using only catwalks raised above the ground, so that none would ever have to step foot on bare ground.</p>
                <p>The first precincts had more resources at their disposal, resulting in these developments to have larger buildings of better quality material; thus they’re more expensive. High-grossing individuals and businesses are found in these “Voids.”</p>
                <p>Later-developed precincts had lower quality materials, thus the less fortunate live higher up. Wobbly supports make for uneasy strides, but there isn’t much other choice.</p>
                <p>The threat of the cursed ground is gone, but there simply aren’t enough resources available to move back to ground-level life.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="Rings">
                <h2>'Undergound' Fight Clubs -- The Rings</h2>
                <p>While legal, brutal fight clubs make efforts to hide themselves from the eyes of the Clergy. The less attention the Clergy dedicates to the 43, the better.</p>
                <p>The ‘Rings’ are a mainstay in many a Category 43s’ life. Many businesses are dedicated in whole to them. Hosting, catering…. clean up. These fighting events serve as a main source of entertainment in all the Precincts.</p>
                <p>There are those who don’t enjoy the concept of the Rings, namely those who choose to lead calmer lives centered around family or hopeful peace. At times there are great divides between these two groups, but they do unite if a need arises.</p>
                <h3>Quarter-Thumbs-Up</h3>
                <p>The Quarter-Thumbs-Up is a practice held by those leading a life centered around the Rings. In any form of competition—be it physical or verbal—a ‘quarter-thumbs-up’ may be raised by one party. During combat (almost exclusively one-on-one), this action means they see their rival as a worthy opponent and wish to cast aside support. This would result in no weapons, armor, magic, or even defending oneself against blows. Any blows thrown must not be blocked, dodged, or avoided in any way. Refusal of the proposition or violation of these tenets is heavily looked down upon, it is considered sacrilege.</p>
                <p>In other scenarios, a quarter-thumbs-up can represent a proposal to speak nothing but truth in a conversation. Refusal of this is more gracefully accepted, but acceptance bears great respect between both parties.</p>
                <p>There are few that are unfamiliar with this practice, but most of everyone knows of its significance. Courtrooms, brawls, and theaters alike fall silent upon a proposal.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="Exiled">
                <h2>Exiled to Enlisted</h2>
                <p><i>“Listen, if you want a surefire way to better your situation, there’s only one option: Enlist. Either you find success or die trying. Both sounded like an improvement to me.” — Silas “Kaiser” Kaidan</i></p>
                <p>There are those among the Category 43 who have chosen, or been forced, to work limitedly alongside the Clergy to gain some benefits for all of Deadlock. While relations exist, interactions are by no means friendly.</p>
                <p>Some Category 43 enlist themselves to be sent on special missions far outside of Deadlock, executing dangerous threats or collecting resources for specific purposes. Rewards range from payment to better equipment to pursue more quests.</p>
                <p>Those who enlist are assigned squad letters. Each squad receives new titles beginning with that same letter; often effectively replacing each squad members’ surname. Because the titles are assigned to entire groups, it is common for a member’s new name to be an alliteration.</p>
                <h3>Respiratory Engines</h3>
                <p>Category 43 who work the respiratory engines for Braefall are exposed to a lot more Foul Air and Fixed Air than the average person, which is already above normal. The engines filter out Pollutants from within Braefall and release it. Workers without respiratory masks are always undergoing Narcosis and find it difficult to continue working. This often causes other medical issues as well.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="Reckoning">
                <h2>The Reckoning</h2>
                <p><i>“How long has it been since you’ve touched the dirt? How much longer will it be?” — Amano Kuze</i></p>
                <p>The Reckoning took many lives. In short, the ground grew hungry and absorbed all organic life standing atop it. Flora and Fauna both, everything standing on natural soil withered away and died in seconds; there was no warning.</p>
                <p>For a long time after, any who step foot on soil would meet the same fate regardless of how thick their sole was.</p>
                <p>The term: “Reckoning” refers to both the instant necrotic death of the majority of organic life, as well as the duration of time where the ground was unsafe to traverse.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="Other">
                <h3>Climate</h3>
                <p>The climate of the world is now very extreme. Daytime is scorching, regularly reaching temperatures of 100-120 degrees. Nighttime gets terribly cold due to the lack of oxygen to insulate throughout the night. Temperatures ranging from the negatives to 40 degrees are common.</p>
                <p>Huge storms form in a few days, and are very common. Cloud-to-Cloud arcs dominate, lightning is blindingly bright. Rain is sparse, and formulates as acid rain (due to HNO3); corroding metal and eating through stone.</p>
                <h3>Landscape</h3>
                <p>The organic life on this world is dead and gone. In the wake of the Reckoning, once-lush valleys were left as sweltering pits full of dense air. Calm plains are now dry and cracked desperately trying to remember what once was. Higher elevations have lighter air and are considered “safer.” Agriculture is impossible without extreme care.</p>
                <h3>Visual</h3>
                <p>The now fabled blue sky that once was is now permanently in a brown-orange haze, sometimes a sickly green-gray on poorer days. A long drawn-out sunset appears daily as bloodreds and coppers. High altitude yellow-gray cloud bands trace the sky, almost mocking the tilled farmland of a bygone age. Occasional Auroras appear when enough magic is released into the surrounding area.</p>
                <h3>Health</h3>
                <p>Respiratory masks are a must when exposed to these conditions. Without it, respiratory problems will arise. Acidosis: memory loss, cognition failure, fatigue, confusion, rapid breathing, muscle weakness and bone-thinning WILL occur, as well as potential Hypoxia.</p>
                <h3>Fire</h3>
                <p>Because of the lacking of Fire Air, nonmagical fire is now a holy symbol, due to its rarity. It is worshipped, ceremonial, and rare to see. The clergy abuses their influence to get access to more fire, deepening the faith of the people in them. Magical fire is seen as heresy. Fire is difficult to achieve because the lack of Fire Air in the atmosphere makes for normal means of producing flame to be unreliable. Sparks, matches, and other means are entirely ineffective. When a fire manages to light, it burns quickly and HOT. This makes boiling water for cooking and everything else very difficult.</p>
