            <h1>Ledger and Lost</h1>
            <p>Welcome to <b>Ledger and Lost</b>, a world devoid of normal hope replaced with noxious particles and gas. 
                This dystopia is an unusual mixing of common Western and Steampunk, creating what I like to call “Dustpunk.”</p>
            <p>You will be playing as part of a group of people called “Category 43.” Below is a concise introduction to what you need to know about some of the game in order to get started on creating some ideas for a character. I am happy to ask any questions and work with you as much as you like.</p>
            <p>Feel free to listen to this as you read through-- for ambience!: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ-SZRQaRqg">Lab Practicum</a></p>

                <p>The Contagion is the colloquial term for the reason everything outside of Braefall and Deadlock is happening. Supermassive dust walls, storms, and hordes of monsters are all still unexplained.</p>

                <h2>The Dust Wall</h2>
                <p>Encircling Braefall and Deadlock together, a massive wall of dust-like particulates stands between these people and the rest of the world. 
                    If you submit to the belief that there is anyone else out there. Most believe that the wall never ends, it covers the entire world. Only by the Clergy's power have they been spared.</p>
                <p>Researchers in Deadlock have discovered that there is some biological matter in the particulate mixture.</p>
            <hr/>
                <h2>Monsters</h2>
                <p>Another reason most believe there is nothing past the wall is due to the sheer amount of entities that stand between
                    Deadlock and the Wall.
                </p>
                <p>An astronomical amount of creatures lurk in the null-space. Some standard creatures are here, but due to the change in environment, evolution has occurred..</p>
                <p>In the sepia-tinted air, any bright colors will attract a lot of attention. Be careful.</p>
                <p>There are times where groups of entities seem to work together to attack Deadlock, in massive waves. 
                    Conjectures as far as patterns and when these attacks will occur are still in the works.
                </p>
                <p>Bodies of the dead--monsters and mortalkind alike--have not decayed for some time. No one knows why. After each horde, the pile of corpes gets larger.
                    Deceased Category 43 are sent on wagons through the old railways into the dust wall, as a symbol of final freedom from this Hell.
