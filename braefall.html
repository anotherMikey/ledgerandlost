            <h1>Ledger and Lost</h1>
            <p>Welcome to <b>Ledger and Lost</b>, a world devoid of normal hope replaced with noxious particles and gas. 
                This dystopia is an unusual mixing of common Western and Steampunk, creating what I like to call “Dustpunk.”</p>
            <p>You will be playing as part of a group of people called “Category 43.” Below is a concise introduction to what you need to know about some of the game in order to get started on creating some ideas for a character. I am happy to ask any questions and work with you as much as you like.</p>
            <p>Feel free to listen to this as you read through-- for ambience!: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ-SZRQaRqg">Lab Practicum</a></p>

        <section id="Braefall">
            <h2>Braefall</h2>
            <p>The “Last Bastion of Breathing” and the “Endstead of Virelsa.” It is all but guaranteed that Braefall is the last safe place for Mortalkind, with everything being burned during The Reckoning. The only reason Braefall stayed safe was due to their Isolationism after the civil war; the city has since hid within their protective “magical bubble."</p>
            <p>Braefall is a socialist theocracy under rule of the Clergy. Every citizen of Braefall has unwavering devotion to the Clergy. The Clergy protects every citizen using their holy power and technology; most notably the Aceta and the Respiratory Engines -- they filter out the unclean air.
            <p>Before the Reckoning, the area around Braefall was very lush and green. At the same time, Braefall was a leader in technological and Magical innovation. Post Reckoning, no contact has been made with the outside world; the common belief is that Braefall is the last civilization on the planet.</p>
            
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>Tall, complex skyscrapers manufactured from metal alloy tower in the sky, almost approaching the wavering bubble formed by the Respiratory Engines. Large recreational buildings such as museums, theater halls, shopping malls, and sporting facilities are in the center of this valley-like circle of skyscrapers.</p>
            <p>Corporate buildings and apartments make up the inside of the Braefall skyline.</p>
            <p>To an outside eye--specifically the Category 43--Braefall is purely utopian.</p>

                <h3>The Aceta -- Heat Elements</h3>
            <p>Along the “magical bubble,” are 4 large basins of a supersaturated solution. Upon activation, the liquid from these basins begin to solidify, and starts towering into the hazy sky. At the end, a towering structure of soft, white crystal reaching 120 feet is created. This, is one of the Aceta.</p>
            <p>The Aceta produce the heat required for life in Braefall. They perform in a cyclical manner; only one should be active at a time, except for a given overlap between one and the next. An esteemed member of the clergy is given the task of activating the next Acetum. </p>
                <p>A sort of ritual is performed: in short, the activation core is snapped (it reforms later). The Acetum begins to grow and glow a hot red deep within, like a himalayan salt lamp. Once activated, the heat emitted from an Acetum helps to recharge the previous, which melts the previously activated acetum.</p>
        
            <h3>Respiratory Engines</h3>
            <p>Category 43 workers or run the respiratory engines for Braefall are exposed to a lot more Foul Air and Fixed Air than the average person, which is already above normal. The engines filter out Pollutants from within Braefall and release it. Workers without respiratory masks are always undergoing Narcosis and find it difficult to continue working. This often causes other medical issues as well.</p>
            <p>Of course, the Category 43 only work these engines because without the supply shipments to Deadlock from Braefall, they would all surely die.</p>
            <p>Depending on where they live or work, Braefall citizens can see Category 43 workers 24/7; they look down on them without pity.</p>

                <h2>Civil War</h2>
                <p>After a religious uprising, the Clergy took control of Eyasluna, renaming it to "Braefall."</p>
                <p>The name comes from a mix between the words “brave” and “fall.” Was originally named Redhallow but during the civil war and the reconstitution it was renamed to Braefall to represent “the God's last holy site.” In this sense, 'God' refers to Apocryth.</p>
